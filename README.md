# Speed-Typer

Quick JavaScript program that times how fast user types the auto-generated text. Once the text matches the input, the timer stops. There are buttons to start over and change generated text. Used event handlers to start/stop timer, match typed text with generated text, and handle button data to either change generated text or start over.
